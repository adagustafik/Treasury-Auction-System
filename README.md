# Treasury Auction System

## Business background

Marketable securities can be bought, sold or transferred after they were originally issued. The U.S.Treasury uses an auction process to sell these securities and determine their rate.


## Main functionality

Admin creates an Auction Announcement based on which securities are issued and sold. After an Auction has ended, admin is able to trigger automatic Auction resolution based on the predefined Auction rules.

Registered users can see Auction Announcements, place bids for currently running Auctions, view placed bids, view public Auction resolution and view purchases they were granted after the resolution.

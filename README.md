# Ways of working

Main branch: `master`

1. Create a branch for the ticket you are working on.
    * Before creating branch make sure you have the latest code on `master`.
    * Make sure you are standing on branch `master`when creating the new branch.
    * Branch should have the same name as the ticket, including the ticket ID.
2. When you think a feature is finished make sure it is working as intended.
3. Before pushing your code run the linter with `npm run checkcode`.
4. Push your code and create pull reqeust for master.
5. Check if there are merge confilsts and resolve them by pulling master into your branch.
